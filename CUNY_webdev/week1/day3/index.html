                <h1>BAJAN STORIES</h1> 
                <p>Barbados is a very special place, and Barbadians are very special people who have many stories to tell. A few you might have already heard, like the one about our hometown sweetheart and mega-star Rihanna, or about cricketing legend, our very own Sir Garfield Sobers. But we have so much more to share with the world and here is where you can read more!
                    Barbados is an eastern Caribbean island and an independent British Commonwealth nation. Bridgetown, the capital, is a cruise-ship port with colonial buildings and Nidhe Israel, a synagogue founded in 1654. Around the island are beaches, botanical gardens, the Harrison’s Cave formation, and 17th-century plantation houses like St. Nicholas Abbey. Local traditions include afternoon tea and cricket, the national sport.
